    <div class="container">
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Boilerplate of C</h3>
            <pre>
    #include<stdio.h>
        int main(){
         printf("hello world")
        return 0;
     }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Variables in C</h3>
        <p>There are three type of variables in C.int value show only integer value, float value show  decimal value, char shows a character.</p> <p>These all value have to put in main function or by defining a function.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box"> <p> Print is used to give the output. Here %d is used for integer, %f is used for float, and %c is used for char value.</p>
        <p> To comment in a single line we use // and to comment multiple line we use /* and end it with */.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box"> 
            <h3 id="head">How to take inpur from user</h3>
            <p>First intialize the all variable.</p>
            <p>To take input from user we use scanf function.And put the symbols for variable and add & sign with variables.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
           <h3 id="head"> Escape sequence value</h3>
           <p>We use \n to chane line, \t to give space between words, \" to apply any quote instead of double quote like \\ to apply \ in line.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">arithmetic instruction</h3>
            <p>+ is used for addition, - is used for subtraction, * is used for multiplication, / is used for division and % is used for remainders.</p>
            <p>we can't write b*c=d but we can write d=b*c.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Type conversion</h3>
            <pre>int+int=int,     float+float=float, <br>int+float=float</pre>
            <p>If we write int=4.8 then it gives 4 beacuse it gives only integer at output.</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Operaters precedence</h3>
            <pre>(* / %) is used first in the sequence after <br> that (+ -) is used and at last = is used.</pre>
             <p> In case of all 1st priority sign is given then order is left to right.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Conditional probability</h3>
            <p>There are two types of conditional probability. first is if-else statement and another is switch statement.</p>
            <p>These statement helps in decision making.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">If-Else statement</h3>
            <p>If-Else statement is used to show the dependency.Like if rain hapeen you are not able to go to college else you can go.</p>
            <p>It basically use in logical questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
           <h3 id="head"> switch statement </h3>
           <p>switch is used as cases like if case 1 happens execute this, if case 2 happens execute this.</p>
           <p>Here we use break to stop execution of other cases.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Relational operators</h3>
            <pre> we use ==(equal to),>=(greater or equal to<br>>(greater), <=(less or equal to), <(less), <br> !=(not equal to) </pre>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Logical operators</h3>
            <p>There are three logical operators.&& is used for AND, || is used for OR and ! is used for NOT. AND is used where both conditions are true. OR is used when at least one condition is true. NOT is used for flip the value.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Else-if statement</h3>
            <p>we use Else-if statement bacause we can't use else multiple times. But we can use only IF multiple times.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Loop cintrol system</h3>
            <p>If we have to print a program many times then we use loops. There are three types of loops. First is while loop second is do-while loop and third is for loop.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head"> While loop</h3>
            <p>While loop is used on given condition.It continued printing value till the condition not get false. for example  if int = 0, print SHIVAM till I is less than 10.In this case it eill print SHIVAM 10 times starting from zero.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Increment and decremant operators</h3>
            <pre>I++ gives i increase by 1 while I-- gives i <br> decrease by 1.  I+2= gives I=I+2.</pre>
            <pre>And when we use sum +=i, <br> it means sum = sum +i.</pre>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Do-While loop</h3>
            <p>While loop checks the condition then execute while Do-while loop excutes first then check the condition.It looks very similar to while loop. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">for loop</h3>
            <p>It is like a shorthand of all loops. In this we can write int value, condition, increment and decrement in same line.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Break and Countinue statrment</h3>
            <p>Break statement breaks the execution where you wants independent of condition on the other hand Countinue statement skip the a condition that you want and then reexecute the program. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Functions</h3>
            <p>Function is use to break our code into chunks so that it is possible for a programmer
                to reuse them.It define something like sum or factorial so that we can use mant times we wants in our code so that we don't write many times.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Function prototype and call</h3>
            <p>A function prototype informs the compiler about a function that will be defined later in
                the program. function call performs the execution when it is called by the code written in main function.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Function definition</h3>
            <p>In this we define what logic does a function contain when it is called in the main function.During call of a function main function got paused and call function prototype and restart again the main function.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Types of function</h3>
            <p>ther are two types of function first is library function tht is pre installed and another is user defined function that defines by the user using his logic.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Important notes </h3>
            <p>A function can return only one value at a time.If the passed variable is changed inside the function, the function call doesn't change the value in the calling function.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Pointers</h3>
            <p>Pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.There are mainly two opertors are used.First is (&) operator used to obtain the address of given variable and the second is (*) operator used to obtain the value present at a given address. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Declearation of a pointer </h3>
            <p>The syntax that is used to declare address is [int *j] and after the j is declare the definition comes [j= &i] which means it stores the address of the variable (i). Basically (*) symbol is used to store and (&) is used for address.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Types of function call</h3>
            <p>There are two types of function call.First is call by value, in this we can't change the value of any variable on calling.Second is call by refrence, in this we use address to call and we change the value using this.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box"><h3 id="head">Arrays</h3>
            <p>In array we can store several elements of similar type.We can declare this like (int marks[90];) which means this array can store 90 values from 0 to 89.Wee can take all thes values from user also using loop. </p>
        </div>
         <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Storation of arrays</h3>
            <p>int marks[3] = {78, 88, 89}  which means the marks array stores three values that is 78, 88. 89.If you given value like that then you are free to write store number because it will count.</p>
         </div>
         <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">Pointer arithmetic</h3>
            <p>In case of arrays, the memory consumed for every value is continuous.We can add or subtract a number to pointer using ++ to a pointer.It will give add more bytes to your value depending upon the bytes taken by your system for specifiers. </p>
         </div>
         <div id="box">
            <h3 id="head">2D-arrays</h3>
            <p>This arrays can be defined as two dimensional which take rows an column.In the case also memory is consumed continuously.We can access these elements using its dimension like [0][0] for first element similarly [0][1] for second.</p>
